## Game of life

Program the game of life. The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states: live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions and rules have to be met:

### Rules.

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### Requirements.

- BEM Methodology.
- Jest testing.
- Husky hooks.
- GitHub Actions.
- Deploy repository on Netlify.
- Upload repository to SonarCloud.
- Protect main branch:
  - Can't push without pull request.
  - Can't push if checks haven't passed.

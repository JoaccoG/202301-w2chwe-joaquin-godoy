## Game of life

Program the game of life.<br>
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states: live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

### Rules.

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### Requirements.

- BEM Methodology.
- Jest _(code testing)._
- Husky _(git hooks)._
- GitHub Actions.
- Deploy your code on Netlify/Vercel for a demo.
- Create SonarCloud for repository _(tests code level)._
- Protect main branch:
  - You can't push without pull request.
  - You can't push if checks haven't passed.

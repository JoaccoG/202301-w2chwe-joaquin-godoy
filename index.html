      <p>
        The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
        Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that it's evolution is determined by its initial state,
        requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and
        observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing
        machine.

      <p>
        The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which
        is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the
        cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions
        occur:
      </p>
      <ol class="rules__list">
        <li>- Any alive cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
        <li>- Any alive cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
        <li>- Any alive cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
      </ol>
